These are the assignments of my Advanced Machine Learning course at AUB.
Here is a small description for each one.

1) Simple Linear and Logistic Regression with L2 regularization.
2) Feed Forward Network for image classification.
3) CNN implementation.
4) Computer Vision:
  - Object Detection: Fine-tuned Deeplabv3_RESNet model and performed Image Segmentation on a flower dataset based on IoU loss. 
  - Face Recognition: Created triplets of images to train Siamese networks, used Xception pre-trained model and applied transfer learning. Performed Face verification and recognition for anchor images.
  - Style Transfer: Used VGGNet pre-trained model. Computed content loss at one convolution layer and style loss using gram matrices at all convolution layers.
5) Image Captioning: Input is a feature-map of an image reduced using PCA (encoder), and the output is a caption describing the image. Implemented forward and backward propagation of RNN, LSTM and word embedding.
6) LLM completion: Completed the architecture of BERT... and applied it for NLP tasks (named entity recognition, natural language inference and sentiment analysis).
